Update your module via module update shortcut in Magisk, or use the built-in updater located in the app   
  
**To install, you will need to:**  
Install LSPosed Zygisk (https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/releases)  
Install the zip file in Magisk (You will be able to install canary builds once the stable version is installed, through in-app updater)
